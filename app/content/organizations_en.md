# Organizations Overview (GMP Ecosystem)

> This page introduces the background, role, key publications and practical value of frequently referenced organizations in GMP. Edit this file to update the content: `app/content/organizations_en.md`.

## WHO (World Health Organization)

WHO publishes GMP-related Technical Report Series (TRS) and guidance that support quality systems and regulatory capacity building across member states.

- Key publications: WHO GMP, annexes (outsourcing, validation, aseptic, data integrity, QRM), PQ docs
- Value: globally applicable, risk-based, suitable for different resource settings
- Use: take WHO as baseline + framework; map to local laws and internal QMS

## FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration)

Guidance for Industry reflects regulatory expectations in the U.S. and is often treated as the de facto “expected practice”.

- Key publications: Process Validation, Data Integrity, CSV/CSA, Quality Metrics; 21 CFR 210/211/11
- Value: practical and operable; highly aligned with ICH Q-series
- Use: prioritize when targeting the U.S. market; use 483/Warning Letters for gap analysis

## ISPE (International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering)

ISPE focuses on engineering and automation best practices with strong implementation details.

- Key publications: Baseline® Guides (water, cleanroom, aseptic, single-use), GAMP® 5, Good Practice Guides
- Value: turns regulatory “what” into engineering “how”
- Use: reference for facility/system design and validation planning (VMP); align with GAMP 5

## PDA (Parenteral Drug Association)

PDA TRs are authoritative in aseptic processing, visual inspection, CCIT and microbiology topics.

- Key publications: TR 22/29/60/76/90 etc.
- Value: deep, science-based, lifecycle and statistics-driven
- Use: map to SOPs/test plans; cross-check with ICH/WHO/FDA guidance

## APIC (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Committee)

APIC targets API industry practices—supplier/changes/data integrity—and offers templates and checklists.

- Key publications: Guidance/How-to on supplier management, audits, change control
- Value: compatible with ICH Q7/Q10; strengthens supply chain governance
- Use: integrate templates into supplier and change processes

## How to combine these?

1) Use ICH/FDA/WHO for principles and expectations.
2) Use ISPE/PDA for implementation details.
3) Use APIC for supply chain and change control.
4) Map them in your QMS from regulation → guidance → SOP/records.
